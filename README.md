PHP Bootstrap Form and CRUD Application Development Exercise.

~~Deployed with Heroku~~

Update: Database no longer deployed via Heroku due to plan changes.
---
In this exercise, I followed along with the course Modern PHP Web Development with MySQL, GitHub and Heroku by Trevoir Williams, Packt Publishing.

Completing this exercise was helpful in reiterating concepts learned in my Database Design class through the implementation of a practical PHP application and remote web server.

I look forward to expanding upon these ideas in future projects.
